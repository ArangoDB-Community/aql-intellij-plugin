<p><code>HASH(value) â†’ hashNumber</code></p>
<p>Calculate a hash value for <em>value</em>.</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>value</strong> (any): an element of arbitrary type</li>
    <li>returns <strong>hashNumber</strong> (number): a hash value of <em>value</em></li>
</ul>
<p><em>value</em> is not required to be a string, but can have any data type. The calculated
    hash value will take the data type of <em>value</em> into account, so for example the
    number <em>1</em> and the string <em>"1"</em> will have different hash values. For arrays the
    hash values will be equal if the arrays contain exactly the same values
    (including value types) in the same order. For objects the same hash values will
    be created if the objects have exactly the same attribute names and values
    (including value types). The order in which attributes appear inside objects
    is not important for hashing.</p>
<p>The hash value returned by this function is a number. The hash algorithm is not
    guaranteed to remain the same in future versions of ArangoDB. The hash values
    should therefore be used only for temporary calculations, e.g. to compare if two
    documents are the same, or for grouping values in queries.</p>
