<p>The <em>LIMIT</em> statement allows slicing the result array using an
    offset and a count. It reduces the number of elements in the result to at most
    the specified number. Two general forms of <em>LIMIT</em> are followed:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-js">LIMIT count
LIMIT offset, count
</code></pre>
<p>The first form allows specifying only the <em>count</em> value whereas the second form
    allows specifying both <em>offset</em> and <em>count</em>. The first form is identical using
    the second form with an <em>offset</em> value of <em>0</em>.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-js">FOR u IN users
  LIMIT <span class="hljs-number">5</span>
  RETURN u
</code></pre>
<p>Above query returns the first five documents of the <em>users</em> collection.
    It could also be written as <code>LIMIT 0, 5</code> for the same result.
    Which documents it actually returns is rather arbitrary, because no explicit
    sorting order is specified however. Therefore, a limit should be usually
    accompanied by a <code>SORT</code> operation.</p>
<p>The <em>offset</em> value specifies how many elements from the result shall be
    skipped. It must be 0 or greater. The <em>count</em> value specifies how many
    elements should be at most included in the result.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-js">FOR u IN users
  SORT u.firstName, u.lastName, u.id DESC
  LIMIT <span class="hljs-number">2</span>, <span class="hljs-number">5</span>
  RETURN u
</code></pre>
<p>In above example, the documents of <em>users</em> are sorted, the first two results
    get skipped and it returns the next five user documents.</p>
<p>Note that variables, expressions and subqueries can not be used for <em>offset</em> and
    <em>count</em>. The values for <em>offset</em> and <em>count</em> must be known at query compile time,
    which means that you can only use number literals, bind parameters or expressions
    that can be resolved at query compile time.</p>
<p>Where a <em>LIMIT</em> is used in relation to other operations in a query has meaning.
    <em>LIMIT</em> operations before <em>FILTER</em>s in particular can change the result
    significantly, because the operations are executed in the order in which they
    are written in the query. See <a href="Filter.html#order-of-operations">FILTER</a> for a
    detailed example.</p>
