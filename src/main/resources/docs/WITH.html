<p>An AQL query can optionally start with a <em>WITH</em> statement and the list of
    collections used by the query. All collections specified in <em>WITH</em> will be
    read-locked at query start, in addition to the other collections the query
    uses and that are detected by the AQL query parser.</p>
<p>Specifying further collections in <em>WITH</em> can be useful for queries that
    dynamically access collections (e.g. via traversals or via dynamic
    document access functions such as <code>DOCUMENT()</code>). Such collections may be
    invisible to the AQL query parser at query compile time, and thus will not
    be read-locked automatically at query start. In this case, the AQL execution
    engine will lazily lock these collections whenever they are used, which can
    lead to deadlock with other queries. In case such deadlock is detected, the
    query will automatically be aborted and changes will be rolled back. In this
    case the client application can try sending the query again.
    However, if client applications specify the list of used collections for all
    their queries using <em>WITH</em>, then no deadlocks will happen and no queries will
    be aborted due to deadlock situations.</p>
<p>From ArangoDB 3.1 onwards <code>WITH</code> is required for traversals in a
    clustered environment in order to avoid deadlocks.</p>
<p>Note that for queries that access only a single collection or that have all
    collection names specified somewhere else in the query string, there is no
    need to use <em>WITH</em>. <em>WITH</em> is only useful when the AQL query parser cannot
    automatically figure out which collections are going to be used by the query.
    <em>WITH</em> is only useful for queries that dynamically access collections, e.g.
    via traversals, shortest path operations or the <em>DOCUMENT()</em> function.</p>
<pre><code>WITH managers, usersHaveManagers
FOR v, e, p IN OUTBOUND 'users/1' GRAPH 'userGraph'
  RETURN { v, e, p }
</code></pre>
<p>Note that constant <em>WITH</em> is also a keyword that is used in other contexts,
    for example in <em>UPDATE</em> statements. If <em>WITH</em> is used to specify the extra
    list of collections, then it must be placed at the very start of the query
    string.</p>
