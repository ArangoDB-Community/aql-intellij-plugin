<p>The <em>SORT</em> statement will force a sort of the array of already produced
    intermediate results in the current block. <em>SORT</em> allows specifying one or
    multiple sort criteria and directions. The general syntax is:</p>
<pre><code>SORT expression direction
</code></pre>
<p>Example query that is sorting by lastName (in ascending order), then firstName
    (in ascending order), then by id (in descending order):</p>
<pre><code>FOR u IN users
  SORT u.lastName, u.firstName, u.id DESC
  RETURN u
</code></pre>
<p>Specifying the <em>direction</em> is optional. The default (implicit) direction for a
    sort expression is the ascending order. To explicitly specify the sort direction,
    the keywords <em>ASC</em> (ascending) and <em>DESC</em> can be used. Multiple sort criteria can be
    separated using commas. In this case the direction is specified for each
    expression sperately. For example</p>
<pre><code>SORT doc.lastName, doc.firstName
</code></pre>
<p>will first sort documents by lastName in ascending order and then by
    firstName in ascending order.</p>
<pre><code>SORT doc.lastName DESC, doc.firstName
</code></pre>
<p>will first sort documents by lastName in descending order and then by
    firstName in ascending order.</p>
<pre><code>SORT doc.lastName, doc.firstName DESC
</code></pre>
<p>will first sort documents by lastName in ascending order and then by
    firstName in descending order.</p>
<p>Note: when iterating over collection-based arrays, the order of documents is
    always undefined unless an explicit sort order is defined using <em>SORT</em>.</p>
<p>Note that constant <em>SORT</em> expressions can be used to indicate that no particular
    sort order is desired. Constant <em>SORT</em> expressions will be optimized away by the AQL
    optimizer during optimization, but specifying them explicitly may enable further
    optimizations if the optimizer does not need to take into account any particular
    sort order. This is especially the case after a <em>COLLECT</em> statement, which is
    supposed to produce a sorted result. Specifying an extra <em>SORT null</em> after the
    <em>COLLECT</em> statement allows to AQL optimizer to remove the post-sorting of the
    collect results altogether.</p>
