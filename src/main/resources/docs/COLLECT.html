</h1>
<p>The <em>COLLECT</em> keyword can be used to group an array by one or multiple group
    criteria. </p>
<p>The <em>COLLECT</em> statement will eliminate all local variables in the current
    scope. After <em>COLLECT</em> only the variables introduced by <em>COLLECT</em> itself are
    available.</p>
<p>The general syntaxes for <em>COLLECT</em> are:</p>
<pre><code>COLLECT variableName = expression options
COLLECT variableName = expression INTO groupsVariable options
COLLECT variableName = expression INTO groupsVariable = projectionExpression options
COLLECT variableName = expression INTO groupsVariable KEEP keepVariable options
COLLECT variableName = expression WITH COUNT INTO countVariable options
COLLECT variableName = expression AGGREGATE variableName = aggregateExpression options
COLLECT AGGREGATE variableName = aggregateExpression options
COLLECT WITH COUNT INTO countVariable options
</code></pre>
<p><code>options</code> is optional in all variants.</p>
<h2 id="grouping-syntaxes">Grouping syntaxes<a class="anchorjs-link " href="#grouping-syntaxes" aria-label="Anchor" data-anchorjs-icon="" style="font: 1em/1 anchorjs-icons; padding-left: 0.375em;"></a>
</h2>
<p>The first syntax form of <em>COLLECT</em> only groups the result by the defined group
    criteria specified in <em>expression</em>. In order to further process the results
    produced by <em>COLLECT</em>, a new variable (specified by <em>variableName</em>) is introduced.
    This variable contains the group value.</p>
<p>Here's an example query that find the distinct values in <em>u.city</em> and makes
    them available in variable <em>city</em>:</p>
<pre><code>FOR u IN users
  COLLECT city = u.city
  RETURN {
    "city" : city
  }
</code></pre>
<p>The second form does the same as the first form, but additionally introduces a
    variable (specified by <em>groupsVariable</em>) that contains all elements that fell into the
    group. This works as follows: The <em>groupsVariable</em> variable is an array containing
    as many elements as there are in the group. Each member of that array is
    a JSON object in which the value of every variable that is defined in the
    AQL query is bound to the corresponding attribute. Note that this considers
    all variables that are defined before the <em>COLLECT</em> statement, but not those on
    the top level (outside of any <em>FOR</em>), unless the <em>COLLECT</em> statement is itself
    on the top level, in which case all variables are taken. Furthermore note
    that it is possible that the optimizer moves <em>LET</em> statements out of <em>FOR</em>
    statements to improve performance. </p>
<pre><code>FOR u IN users
  COLLECT city = u.city INTO groups
  RETURN {
    "city" : city,
    "usersInCity" : groups
  }
</code></pre>
<p>In the above example, the array <em>users</em> will be grouped by the attribute
    <em>city</em>. The result is a new array of documents, with one element per distinct
    <em>u.city</em> value. The elements from the original array (here: <em>users</em>) per city are
    made available in the variable <em>groups</em>. This is due to the <em>INTO</em> clause.</p>
<p><em>COLLECT</em> also allows specifying multiple group criteria. Individual group
    criteria can be separated by commas:</p>
<pre><code>FOR u IN users
  COLLECT country = u.country, city = u.city INTO groups
  RETURN {
    "country" : country,
    "city" : city,
    "usersInCity" : groups
  }
</code></pre>
<p>In the above example, the array <em>users</em> is grouped by country first and then
    by city, and for each distinct combination of country and city, the users
    will be returned.</p>

</h2>
<p>The third form of <em>COLLECT</em> allows rewriting the contents of the <em>groupsVariable</em>
    using an arbitrary <em>projectionExpression</em>:</p>
<pre><code>FOR u IN users
  COLLECT country = u.country, city = u.city INTO groups = u.name
  RETURN {
    "country" : country,
    "city" : city,
    "userNames" : groups
  }
</code></pre>
<p>In the above example, only the <em>projectionExpression</em> is <em>u.name</em>. Therefore,
    only this attribute is copied into the <em>groupsVariable</em> for each document.
    This is probably much more efficient than copying all variables from the scope into
    the <em>groupsVariable</em> as it would happen without a <em>projectionExpression</em>.</p>
<p>The expression following <em>INTO</em> can also be used for arbitrary computations:</p>
<pre><code>FOR u IN users
  COLLECT country = u.country, city = u.city INTO groups = {
    "name" : u.name,
    "isActive" : u.status == "active"
  }
  RETURN {
    "country" : country,
    "city" : city,
    "usersInCity" : groups
  }
</code></pre>
<p><em>COLLECT</em> also provides an optional <em>KEEP</em> clause that can be used to control
    which variables will be copied into the variable created by <code>INTO</code>. If no
    <em>KEEP</em> clause is specified, all variables from the scope will be copied as
    sub-attributes into the <em>groupsVariable</em>.
    This is safe but can have a negative impact on performance if there
    are many variables in scope or the variables contain massive amounts of data. </p>
<p>The following example limits the variables that are copied into the <em>groupsVariable</em>
    to just <em>name</em>. The variables <em>u</em> and <em>someCalculation</em> also present in the scope
    will not be copied into <em>groupsVariable</em> because they are not listed in the <em>KEEP</em> clause:</p>
<pre><code>FOR u IN users
  LET name = u.name
  LET someCalculation = u.value1 + u.value2
  COLLECT city = u.city INTO groups KEEP name
  RETURN {
    "city" : city,
    "userNames" : groups[*].name
  }
</code></pre>
<p><em>KEEP</em> is only valid in combination with <em>INTO</em>. Only valid variable names can
    be used in the <em>KEEP</em> clause. <em>KEEP</em> supports the specification of multiple
    variable names.</p>

</h2>
<p><em>COLLECT</em> also provides a special <em>WITH COUNT</em> clause that can be used to
    determine the number of group members efficiently.</p>
<p>The simplest form just returns the number of items that made it into the
    <em>COLLECT</em>:</p>
<pre><code>FOR u IN users
  COLLECT WITH COUNT INTO length
  RETURN length
</code></pre>
<p>The above is equivalent to, but less efficient than:</p>
<pre><code>RETURN LENGTH(users)
</code></pre>
<p>The <em>WITH COUNT</em> clause can also be used to efficiently count the number
    of items in each group:</p>
<pre><code>FOR u IN users
  COLLECT age = u.age WITH COUNT INTO length
  RETURN {
    "age" : age,
    "count" : length
  }
</code></pre>
<p>Note: the <em>WITH COUNT</em> clause can only be used together with an <em>INTO</em> clause.</p>
<h2 id="aggregation">Aggregation<a class="anchorjs-link " href="#aggregation" aria-label="Anchor" data-anchorjs-icon="" style="font: 1em/1 anchorjs-icons; padding-left: 0.375em;"></a>
</h2>
<p>A <code>COLLECT</code> statement can be used to perform aggregation of data per group. To
    only determine group lengths, the <code>WITH COUNT INTO</code> variant of <code>COLLECT</code> can be
    used as described before.</p>
<p>For other aggregations, it is possible to run aggregate functions on the <code>COLLECT</code>
    results:</p>
<pre><code>FOR u IN users
  COLLECT ageGroup = FLOOR(u.age / 5) * 5 INTO g
  RETURN {
    "ageGroup" : ageGroup,
    "minAge" : MIN(g[*].u.age),
    "maxAge" : MAX(g[*].u.age)
  }
</code></pre>
<p>The above however requires storing all group values during the collect operation for
    all groups, which can be inefficient. </p>
<p>The special <code>AGGREGATE</code> variant of <code>COLLECT</code> allows building the aggregate values
    incrementally during the collect operation, and is therefore often more efficient.</p>
<p>With the <code>AGGREGATE</code> variant the above query becomes:</p>
<pre><code>FOR u IN users
  COLLECT ageGroup = FLOOR(u.age / 5) * 5
  AGGREGATE minAge = MIN(u.age), maxAge = MAX(u.age)
  RETURN {
    ageGroup,
    minAge,
    maxAge
  }
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>AGGREGATE</code> keyword can only be used after the <code>COLLECT</code> keyword. If used, it
    must directly follow the declaration of the grouping keys. If no grouping keys
    are used, it must follow the <code>COLLECT</code> keyword directly:</p>
<pre><code>FOR u IN users
  COLLECT AGGREGATE minAge = MIN(u.age), maxAge = MAX(u.age)
  RETURN {
    minAge,
    maxAge
  }
</code></pre>
<p>Only specific expressions are allowed on the right-hand side of each <code>AGGREGATE</code>
    assignment:</p>
<ul>
    <li><p>on the top level, an aggregate expression must be a call to one of the supported
        aggregation functions <code>LENGTH</code>, <code>MIN</code>, <code>MAX</code>, <code>SUM</code>,
        <code>AVERAGE</code>, <code>STDDEV_POPULATION</code>,
        <code>STDDEV_SAMPLE</code>, <code>VARIANCE_POPULATION</code>, <code>VARIANCE_SAMPLE</code>, <code>UNIQUE</code>,
        <code>SORTED_UNIQUE</code>
        or <code>COUNT_DISTINCT</code>. The following aliases are allowed too: <code>COUNT</code> (for
        <code>LENGTH</code>),
        <code>AVG</code> (for <code>AVERAGE</code>), <code>STDDEV</code> (for <code>STDDEV_POPULATION</code>),
        <code>VARIANCE</code> (for <code>VARIANCE_POPULATION</code>),
        <code>COUNT_UNIQUE</code> (for <code>COUNT_DISTINCT</code>).</p>
    </li>
    <li><p>an aggregate expression must not refer to variables introduced by the <code>COLLECT</code> itself</p>
    </li>
</ul>

</h2>
<p>Since ArangoDB 2.6, there are two variants of <em>COLLECT</em> that the optimizer can
    choose from: the <em>sorted</em> variant and the <em>hash</em> variant. The <em>hash</em> variant only becomes a
    candidate for <em>COLLECT</em> statements that do not use an <em>INTO</em> clause.</p>
<p>The optimizer will always generate a plan that employs the <em>sorted</em> method. The <em>sorted</em> method
    requires its input to be sorted by the group criteria specified in the <em>COLLECT</em> clause.
    To ensure correctness of the result, the AQL optimizer will automatically insert a <em>SORT</em>
    statement into the query in front of the <em>COLLECT</em> statement. The optimizer may be able to
    optimize away that <em>SORT</em> statement later if a sorted index is present on the group criteria. </p>
<p>In case a <em>COLLECT</em> statement qualifies for using the
    <em>hash</em> variant, the optimizer will create an extra
    plan for it at the beginning of the planning phase. In this plan, no extra <em>SORT</em> statement will be
    added in front of the <em>COLLECT</em>. This is because the <em>hash</em> variant of
    <em>COLLECT</em> does not require
    sorted input. Instead, a <em>SORT</em> statement will be added after the <em>COLLECT</em> to sort its output.
    This <em>SORT</em> statement may be optimized away again in later stages.
    If the sort order of the <em>COLLECT</em> is irrelevant to the user, adding the extra instruction <em>SORT null</em>
    after the <em>COLLECT</em> will allow the optimizer to remove the sorts altogether:</p>
<pre><code>FOR u IN users
  COLLECT age = u.age
  SORT null  /* note: will be optimized away */
  RETURN age
</code></pre>
<p>Which <em>COLLECT</em> variant is used by the optimizer depends on the optimizer's cost estimations. The
    created plans with the different <em>COLLECT</em> variants will be shipped through the regular optimization
    pipeline. In the end, the optimizer will pick the plan with the lowest estimated total cost as usual. </p>
<p>In general, the <em>sorted</em> variant of <em>COLLECT</em> should be preferred in cases when there is a sorted index
    present on the group criteria. In this case the optimizer can eliminate the <em>SORT</em> statement in front
    of the <em>COLLECT</em>, so that no <em>SORT</em> will be left. </p>
<p>If there is no sorted index available on the group criteria, the up-front sort required by the <em>sorted</em>
    variant can be expensive. In this case it is likely that the optimizer will prefer the <em>hash</em> variant
    of <em>COLLECT</em>, which does not require its input to be sorted. </p>
<p>Which variant of <em>COLLECT</em> was actually used can be figured out by looking into the execution plan of
    a query, specifically the <em>AggregateNode</em> and its <em>aggregationOptions</em> attribute.</p>
<h2 id="setting-collect-options">Setting COLLECT options<a class="anchorjs-link " href="#setting-collect-options" aria-label="Anchor" data-anchorjs-icon="" style="font: 1em/1 anchorjs-icons; padding-left: 0.375em;"></a>
</h2>
<p><em>options</em> can be used in a <em>COLLECT</em> statement to inform the optimizer about the preferred
    <em>COLLECT</em>
    method. When specifying the following appendix to a <em>COLLECT</em> statement, the optimizer will always use
    the <em>sorted</em> variant of <em>COLLECT</em> and not even create a plan using the <em>hash</em> variant:</p>
<pre><code>OPTIONS { method: "sorted" }
</code></pre>
<p>It is also possible to specify <em>hash</em> as the preferred method. In this case the optimizer will create
    a plan using the <em>hash</em> method only if the COLLECT statement qualifies (not all COLLECT statements
    can use the <em>hash</em> method). In case the COLLECT statement qualifies, there will be only a one plan
    that uses the <em>hash</em> method. If it does not qualify, the optimizer will use the <em>sorted</em> method.</p>
<p>If no method is specified, then the optimizer will create a plan that uses the <em>sorted</em> method, and
    an additional plan using the <em>hash</em> method if the COLLECT statement qualifies for it.</p>

</h2>
<p>In order to make a result set unique, one can either use <em>COLLECT</em> or <em>RETURN DISTINCT</em>. Behind the
    scenes, both variants will work by creating an <em>AggregateNode</em>. For both variants, the optimizer
    may try the sorted and the hashed variant of <em>COLLECT</em>. The difference is therefore mainly syntactical,
    with <em>RETURN DISTINCT</em> saving a bit of typing when compared to an equivalent <em>COLLECT</em>:</p>
<pre><code>FOR u IN users
  RETURN DISTINCT u.age
</code></pre>
<pre><code>FOR u IN users
  COLLECT age = u.age
  RETURN age
</code></pre>
<p>However, <em>COLLECT</em> is vastly more flexible than
    <em>RETURN DISTINCT</em>. Additionally, the order of results is
    undefined for a <em>RETURN DISTINCT</em>, whereas for a <em>COLLECT</em> the results will be sorted.</p>
